    <p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was one of the most influential physicists in history, reshaping humanity’s understanding of space, time, and energy. Born in Ulm, Germany, he showed an early talent for mathematics and curiosity about how the universe works. Although he struggled with rigid schooling environments, he later studied physics at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich. In 1905, while working as a patent clerk in Bern, he published four groundbreaking papers that transformed modern physics. These works introduced the theory of special relativity and the famous equation E = mc², which revealed that mass and energy are interchangeable.

In 1915, Einstein expanded his ideas into the general theory of relativity, proposing that gravity is not simply a force but the result of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass. This theory was confirmed in 1919 when scientists observed the bending of light during a solar eclipse, making him internationally famous. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, a key development in quantum theory. His scientific achievements fundamentally changed physics and continue to influence research in cosmology and particle physics today.

Beyond science, Einstein was known for his humanitarian values and philosophical reflections. As a pacifist, he fled Nazi Germany in 1933 and settled in the United States, joining the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.

Roosevelt about the possibility of atomic weapons during World War II, he later advocated for nuclear disarmament and global cooperation. With his distinctive appearance and imaginative spirit, Einstein became a cultural symbol of intelligence, creativity, and intellectual courage.</p>
