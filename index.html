    <p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who transformed modern science through his theories of special and general relativity. In 1905, while working as a patent clerk, he published four groundbreaking papers that explained the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and presented the equation E=mc². His general theory of relativity (1915) redefined gravity as the curvature of spacetime and brought him global fame after experimental confirmation in 1919. He won the 1921 Nobel Prize for his work on the photoelectric effect. Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1933, he settled in the United States, where he later advocated for nuclear disarmament and global cooperation. Beyond physics, Einstein became a cultural icon symbolizing creativity, curiosity, and intellectual courage.</p>
